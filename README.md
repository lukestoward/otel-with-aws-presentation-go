## OpenTelemetry with AWS Presentation Go Meetup (London Gophers)

This repository contains the source code and slides presented at the [London Gophers meetup](https://www.meetup.com/londongophers/events/287490709/) in October 2022.

If you are interested in watching the presentation, I will link the YouTube recording below once it becomes available.

### Summary

The presentation broadly introduces OpenTelemetry before diving into what OpenTelemetry Tracing is, why you should use it and tracing considerations. Next I introduce the OpenTelemetry Collector and how it fits in the wider architecture. Finally, I demo AWS X-Ray by generating some traces using the sample code available in the repo.
